           <h1>Professional Self-Assessment</h1>
           
           <h2>Introduction</h2>
           <p>As I complete my Computer Science degree at Southern New Hampshire University, I reflect on my academic journey and the development of this ePortfolio as significant milestones in my professional growth. The Grazios Rescue System, featured in this portfolio, represents the culmination of my technical knowledge, skills, and professional values developed throughout my academic career. This comprehensive animal rescue management system demonstrates my ability to design and implement complex software solutions that address real-world needs while adhering to industry best practices.</p>

           <h2>Professional Growth and Strengths</h2>
           
           <h3>Collaborating in a Team Environment</h3>
           <p>Throughout my academic journey, I've developed strong collaboration skills that are essential in today's team-based software development environments. During a working internship with Teamwyrk.com, I worked with a diverse group to develop a mobile application, where I learned to effectively use Git for version control and implement agile methodologies. This experience taught me how to navigate the complexities of team dynamics, resolve conflicts constructively, and integrate diverse perspectives to enhance project outcomes.</p>
           <p>Beyond the classroom, I've extended these skills through participation in developing designr equirements for a new inventory system at the Department of Transportation. These experiences reinforced my ability to quickly adapt to different team structures and communication styles while maintaining focus on project goals. In developing the Grazios Rescue System, I implemented comprehensive documentation practices specifically designed to support team collaboration, demonstrating my understanding that well-documented code is essential for effective knowledge sharing and team scalability.</p>

           <h3>Communicating with Stakeholders</h3>
           <p>Effective stakeholder communication has been a central focus of my development as a computer science professional. In the CS-250 Software Development Lifecycle course, I learned to translate technical concepts into language accessible to non-technical stakeholders, a skill I refined while creating detailed user stories and requirements documentation for a healthcare scheduling system. This project taught me the importance of active listening and regular feedback cycles in ensuring alignment between technical implementation and business needs.</p>
           <p>I've also developed my stakeholder communication skills through my employment, where I built a simple compliance review tracking system which documents and aggregates findings throughout 332 stock locations. This real-world application required me to conduct stakeholder interviews, create prototype demonstrations, and adjust technical solutions based on user feedback. The documentation tools I developed for the Grazios Rescue System reflect this stakeholder-focused approach, with clear visual demonstrations of system capabilities designed to bridge the gap between technical and non-technical audiences.</p>

           <h3>Data Structures and Algorithms</h3>
           <p>My Computer Science curriculum has provided me with aa excellent foundation in data structures and algorithms, which I've continuously strengthened through a combination of academic work and independent projects. In Data Structures and Algorithms, I implemented various sorting algorithms and data structures from scratch, developing a deep understanding of their performance characteristics and appropriate use cases.</p>
           <p>I further expanded this knowledge when I participated in a few different coding competitions, where I solved complex algorithmic challenges that required optimizing for both time and space complexity. This experience improved my ability to select the most appropriate algorithms for specific scenarios and analyze performance trade-offs. In the Grazios Rescue System, I demonstrated this expertise by implementing three distinct matching algorithms (weighted attribute matching, service-specific matching, and priority queue matching), each optimized for different use cases within the animal rescue domain. This implementation showcases my ability to apply theoretical concepts to practical challenges while managing the inherent trade-offs between different algorithmic approaches.</p>

           <h3>Software Engineering and Database</h3>
           <p>My journey in software engineering and database design has evolved from understanding fundamental concepts to implementing sophisticated architectural patterns. In CS-340 Client/Server Development, I gained experience with MongoDB and learned to design NoSQL schemas that balance flexibility with data integrity. This knowledge was complemented by CS-465 Full Stack Development, where I applied the MVC architectural pattern to create a RESTful API backend with an Angular frontend.</p>
           <p>I've expanded these skills through an independent project where I developed a personal finance tracking application using a microservices architecture with containerized deployments via Docker. This project taught me to implement continuous integration practices and deepened my understanding of service-oriented architecture principles. The Grazios Rescue System demonstrates this expertise through its well-structured MVC backend, sophisticated MongoDB implementation utilizing the discriminator pattern for inheritance, and comprehensive transaction support to maintain data consistency across related collections. These features showcase my ability to design scalable, maintainable software systems that address complex domain requirements.</p>

           <h3>Security</h3>
           <p>Security has been a critical component of my computer science education and professional development. I have learned to identify and mitigate common security vulnerabilities, implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms, and conduct security code reviews. I applied these principles in a group project that required implementing a secure user management system with role-based access control.</p>
           <p>I've further developed my security mindset through obtaining the CompTIA Security+ certification, which expanded my knowledge of network security, cryptography, and security governance. In the Grazios Rescue System, security considerations are evident throughout the implementation, from JWT-based authentication to secure database connections with proper error handling that prevents information leakage. The system's validation middleware protects against injection attacks and ensures data integrity, demonstrating my commitment to building systems that prioritize security at every level.</p>

           <h2>Portfolio Artifacts Overview</h2>
           <p>The Grazios Rescue System, featured in this ePortfolio, consists of three key components that collectively demonstrate the breadth and depth of my computer science knowledge and skills:</p>

           <h3>Software Design Enhancement</h3>
           <p>The first artifact, found by clicking on the Software Design button, showcases my software design capabilities through comprehensive documentation and code organization. I transformed the original codebase into a professionally documented project following industry best practices by adding JSDoc documentation throughout the system. This enhancement demonstrates my understanding of software architecture principles and my ability to create maintainable code that supports team collaboration.</p>

           <h3>Algorithms and Data Structures Enhancement</h3>
